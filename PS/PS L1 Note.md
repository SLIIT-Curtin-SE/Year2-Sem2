# Lecture 01
## Introduction to Statistics
- Statistics is the `study` of `uncertainty`
## Terminology
### Population
- This is a `collection of set of individuals or objects` where researcher is interested about drawing inferences.
- Population can be `finite` or `infinite`
- Collect data from all the individuals in the population is called `census survey`
### Sample 
- A `sub set` of the population.
- Collect data from a part of the population(sample), then it is known as a `Sample Survey.`
### Variable 
- Variable is a `characteristic/property of each individual` in the population or a sample.
- Eg: Age, Gender, Temperature...
- Normally use `capital letters` to `denote variables.`
### Data
- The value of the variable associated with `one element of a population or sample`
- This value may be `a number, a word, or a symbol`
### Parameter 
- Parameter is a `summary characteristic` about the individuals in `population`
- Parameter is always `related with the population`
- Eg: Population mean, Population variance, Population proportion
### Statistic 
- Statistic is a `summary characteristics` about the `individuals in the sample`
- Statistic is always `related with the sample`
- Eg: Sample mean, Sample variance, Sample proportion 
### Experiment 
- An experiment is a `planned activity` whose `results yield a set of data`

## Types of Variables
### Qualitative/Attribute/Categorical Variable
- A  variable that `categorizes and describes an element.` Eg : Hair color, Gender, Martial Status
### Quantitative/Numerical Variable 
- A variable that quantifies an element. Eg: Marks for Statistics, Age, Temperature 
## Qualitative Variables
### Nominal Variables 
- Categories are not `naturally ordered.` Eg : Gender, Hair Color,Marital Status
### Ordinal Variables
- Categories are `naturally ordered.` Eg: Satisfaction Rating, Highest education qualification 
## Quantitative Variables 
### Discrete Variables
- `Distance between two value` exists.We can include `whole numbers.` Eg: Number of accidents ina junction, Age in years
### Continuous Variables
- This will contain `any value within a given range.`We can include `decimal numbers` Eg: Temperature, Heart beat of a patient 
## Measurement Scales
- Normal data -> Ordinal Data -> Interval Data -> Ratio Data
## Interval Scale VS Ratio Scale

| Interval Scale        | Ratio Scale           | 
| ------------- |-------------| 
| Variables can be added and subtracted.<br> But ratio and multiplication is not possible      | Including ratio and multiplication of an interval scale | 
| Can calculate mean, median and mode | Can calculate mean, median and mode |   
| Difference between variables can be evaluated | Difference between variables can be evaluated|
| Does not have zero point | True zero point exist | 
| Eg: Temperature | Eg: Height, Weight |
## Areas of Statistics
### Descriptive Statics 
- This is also known as `preliminary analysis / explanatory analysis.`
- This will give you a rough idea about the `behavior of data`
- It describes how the each of the `variables behave.` 
- There are two methods that can use under descriptive statistics. They are, `Graphical Method, Numerical Method`
### Inferential Statistics 
- Under this there are two main areas namely, `parameter estimation, hypothesis testing`
