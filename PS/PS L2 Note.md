## Sampling Methods

## Introduction to Sampling

- Data should be `collected before describing.`
- If a sampling survey is done, should plan how to select the sample.

### Two types of sampling

- Probability Sampling
- Non - Probability Sampling

### Reasons for Drawing a sampling

- `Less time` consuming than a census
- `Less costly` to administrator than a census
- `Less cumbersome and more practical` to administrator than a census of the targeted population

### **Non - probability sampling**

- Uses a `subjective(Non - random) method`
- Does not require `a sampling/survey frame`
- `Fast, easy and expensive`
- Same might not be `representative of the population`
- Chance of each `element being selected, cannot be calculated`
- Can be applied to studies that are used as: <br>`an idea generating tool`, <br>
  `a preliminary step` and<br>
  `follow-up step`

### Non - probability sampling methods

- **Convenience Sampling**

1.  Obtain a `sample of convenient elements.`
2.  Often, respondents are selected because they happen to be in the right place at the right time.
3.  Eg: Interviewing people on the street

- **Judgment Sampling**

1. `Based on previous` ideas about the population.
2. Subject to the researcher's biases.
3. Can be more biased than haphazard sampling.

- **Quota Sampling**

1. One of the most common forms of non-probability sampling
2. Sampling is done until a specific number of units (quotas) for `various subpopulations` has been selected
3. Market researchers often use quota sampling(particularly for telephone surveys)

### **Probability Sampling**

- Based on the `principle of randomization or chance`
- More `complex, time consuming and usually more costly`
- `More reliable`
- Requires a `sampling/Survey frame`
- Can use computers or other methods to select elements randomly. (Random number table)

### Sampling Frame

- The `list of elements` from which a sample may be drawn
- Also known as **working population**
- Eg: Telephone directory, List of voters

### probability sampling methods

-`Simple Random Sampling(SRS)`

- `Systematic Sampling(SYS)`
- Probability-proportion-to-size(PPS)Sampling
- `Cluster Sampling`
- `Stratified Sampling(STR)`
- `Multi-Stage Sampling`
- Multi-phase Sampling
- Replicate Sampling
